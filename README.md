# My hobby project: WiFi Arduino radar
This project uses Arduino board MKR 1000 to control servo motor and broadcast the data collected from the ultrasonic sensor to local network through WiFi. Then the computer end receives the data and display the radar diagram. For the computer end, the program that displays the radar diagram is written in processing language. The four dots in the diagram don't have any functionality.
