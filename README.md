# WiFi Arduino radar
This project used an Arduino MKR 1000 and a computer, other sensors and parts to achieve the goal of radar.

The mechanism of this project is that MKR 1000 controls servo motor and broadcasts the data collected from the ultrasonic sensor to local network through WiFi. Then the computer end receives the data and displays the radar diagram. For the computer end, the program that displays the radar diagram was written in processing language. The four dots in the diagram don't have any functionality.

Those pictures were screen shots of my video. Unfortunately it was not recorded in English.
